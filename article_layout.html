                        The dashboard is the first thing you see when you log in to Canvas and shows the global
                        navigation bar, your courses, your to do list and any recent feedback you have received. The
                        dashboard will also display global announcements to alert you of any important updates. You
                        can
                        customise your display
                        by selecting card view, list view or recent activity mode through the options menu on the
                        top
